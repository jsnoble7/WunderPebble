WunderPebble
============
This is my first attempt at a Pebble app and I'd like to make it a good one. I'm trying to make an app that allows you to pull your tasks and lists from Wunderlist. Eventually the app will also let you read task descriptions and close tasks much like you would using a native app. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

##Things left to do

* --Access Wunderlist--
* --Communication between Phone and app--
* --Get Lists--
* --Retrieve Tasks--
* Close Tasks
* Read Task Description
* Get Subtasks (low priority)
