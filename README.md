WunderPebble
============
This is my first attempt at a Pebble app and I'd like to make it a good one. I'm trying to make an app that allows you to pull today's tasks from Wunderlist. Eventually the app will also let you select lists and close tasks.

##Things left to do

* Access Wunderlist (partially done)
* Communication between Phone and app (partially done)
* Select list
* Close tasks
* Read task description
* Get subtasks
